DATA
A series of activity recognition measurements were performed on multiple subjects under various test conditions, such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying. 

The data reflects calculated average measurements using signals collected by a Samsung Galaxy mobile device.The calculations have been performed on an initial set of feature variables representing estimated mean and standard deviations of raw accelerator and gyroscope signals. These signals were first transformed and separated in body and gravity acceleration signals in 3-axial directions (X, Y, Z). Please see below the list of signals:

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

TRANSFORMATION OF INITIAL DATASET
The initial dataset has been obtained from the following location:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Tranformation on the initial dataset have been performed to get to the data included in the txt file.
The data in the txt file represent the averages of all mean and standard deviation measurements for each activity and each human subject from which measurements were collected.

The initial data set was transformed using the following major steps:
    a) Merging of the training and the test sets to create one data set
    b) Extraction of estimated mean and standard deviation for each type of signal measurement 
    c) Descriptive identification of activity names
    d) Labeling of the data set with descriptive variable names
    e) Finally, an independent tidy data set was was created with the average of each variable 
       for each activity and each human subject

These variables have been calculated for each activity and each human subject.
